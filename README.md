# E-mail Sender

This project is a simple PHP-based email sender that allows users to send emails with their name, last name, email address, and message.


## Prerequisites

To run the project, you'll need a PHP-enabled web server. If you're using XAMPP, you can place the project files in the `htdocs` directory and start Apache.

## Usage

To use the email sender, simply navigate to `index.php` in your web browser. You'll be presented with a form that allows you to enter your name, last name, email address, and message. Once you've entered your details, click the "SEND" button to send the email.

If the email is sent successfully, you'll be redirected to a page that says "Email Sent". If there was an error sending the email, you'll see an error message.
